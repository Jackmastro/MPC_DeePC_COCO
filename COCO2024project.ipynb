    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a control expert, and you are asked to act as a consultant for InsulinCo, a company that provides [artificial pancreas](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/pluginfile.php/2009034/mod_resource/content/1/Diabetes_101.pdf) (AP) care to patients with diabetes. Their AP uses an insulin pump to inject insulin in response to glucose measurements and meal predictions. Currently, their AP uses a PID controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "InsulinCo would like to know if an advanced control method can improve the performance of their AP. You are provided with this Jupyter notebook to develop controller prototypes and provide an answer for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "InsulinCo is interested in a model-based AP controller, as well as a data-driven AP controller. They want to know if they should pursue a product direction that involves a model that they, perhaps, modify for each patient, or a product direction that relies only upon data from the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support the model-based approach, InsulinCo has provided a nonlinear model for a specific patient and the linearization of the model at a steady-state operating point. To support the data-driven approach, InsulinCo has provided the time series data for a single patient that they would like you to use for the data-driven controller. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test/validate the controllers you develop, InsulinCo has provided you with the [ReplayBG simulator](https://github.com/gcappon/py_replay_bg/tree/master), developed by the company ReplayBGCo, which simulates the nonlinear dynamics of a human glucose regulation mechanism. For the (first) model-based and data-driven controllers that you design, InsulinCo would like you to just use the ReplayBG simulator for testing, not generating additional data. \n",
    "\n",
    "InsulinCo is also curious about partnering with ReplayBGCo. To make this decision, they need to know if they could improve their AP controller if they had a full commercial license for the ReplayBG simulator. For bonus credit, use the ReplayBG simulator, or data from the simulator, to either improve upon one of the two AP controllers you proposed in a significant manner, or demonstrate a new controller which requires a simulator or more data.\n"

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is the blood glucose. This hypoglycemia limit of 70 (mg/dl) is a hard lower-limit for blood glucose, as dropping below 70 (mg/dl) is a significant health risk. In addition, if possible, blood glucose should be kept below 180 (mg/dl). This hyperglycemia limit is a \"soft constraint\" rather than a hard constraint---minor infractions are not critical, but it is better to keep blood glucose below 180 (mg/dl) if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Two inputs affect glucose levels:\n",
    "- $i(t)$: Exogenous/Basal insulin injections (units \"U\" of insulin). Controlled.\n",
    "- $m(t)$: Carbohydrate intake/\"meals\" (g). Not controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the input is two-dimensional: $\\textbf{u} = \\begin{bmatrix}i(t) & m(t) \\end{bmatrix}^T$. In the literature, $i(t)$ is also refered to as I(t) or basal_insulin, and $m(t)$ is also refered to as $CHO(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we cannot control the meals, we assume that the meal injections are known by the controller (hence, being an \"input\" rather than a disturbance). \n",
    "\n",
    "The meals are determined by the `data_cho.csv` file and are parsed by the get_discretized_meals() function, which multiplies the values in the data.csv file by 5 because each meal takes 5 minuntes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The controller determines the exogenous insulin injection in control time intervals that are specified by the user (e.g. 5 or 10 minutes). The control time interval is a design decision for you to make. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insulin Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum exogenous/basal insulin injection $i(t)$ is 0.04, and the minimum is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Meal Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The default meal values, which InsulinCo is interested in with the initial (model-based and data-driven) control designs, are 35 g for breakfast and 45 g for lunch and dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the bonus, you might consider larger/different meals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Variables\n",
    "The state of the system is defined by the following variables:\n",
    "- $G_p(t)$: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dl);\n",
    "- $X(t)$: Insulin action on glucose disposal and production ($min^{-1}$);\n",
    "- $Q_{sto1}(t)$: Amount of insulin in the stomach in solid state (mg/kg);\n",
    "- $Q_{sto2}(t)$: Amount of insulin in the stomach in liquid state (mg/kg);\n",
    "- $Q_{gut}(t)$: Glucose concentration in the intestine (mg/kg);\n",
    "- $I_{sc1}(t)$: Insulin in a non-monomeric state (mU/kg);\n",
    "- $I_{sc2}(t)$: Insulin in a monomeric state (mU/kg);\n",
    "- $I_p(t)$: Plasma insulin concentration (mU/I);\n",
    "- $G(t)$: interstitial glucose concentration (mg/dl);\n",
    "\n",
    "For following the ReplayBG practices, the state equation is set as: $x(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} G_p(t) & X(t) & Q_{sto1}(t) & Q_{sto2}(t) & Q_{gut}(t) & I_{sc1}(t) & I_{sc2}(t)& I_p(t) & G(t) \\end{bmatrix}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Equations\n",
    "The Non-Linear Differential Equations which describe the behavior of the system are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{G_p}(t) = -[SG + \\rho(G)X(t)] \\cdot G_p(t) + SG \\cdot G_{b} + R_{\\alpha}(t)/V_G$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{X}(t) = -p_2 \\cdot [X(t) - SI \\cdot (I_p(t) - I_pb)]$\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\dot{I}_{p}(t) = k_{\\alpha2} \\cdot I_{sc2}(t) - k_{e} \\cdot I_{p}(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{G}(t) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}(G(t) - G_p(t))$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $k_{d}, k_{\\alpha2}, k_e, \\beta, k_{empt}, k_{abs}, \\alpha, p_2$ are parameters describing the rate of diffusion and absorption of insulin, $V_{I}$ is the volume of insulin distribution, $R_{\\alpha}(t)$ is the rate of glucose appearance in plasma, $SG$ is the glucose effectiveness, $G_b$ is the basal glucose concentration in the plasma, $V_G$ is the volume of glucose distribution, $I_{pb}$ is the basal insulin concentration in the plasma, $SI$ is the insulin sensitivity, $\\rho(G)$ is a function to better represent glucose dynamics in the hypoglycemic range. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $I$ variables and the associated equaitons describe the absorption dynamics of exogenous insulin infusion to the plasma, the $Q$ variables describe the glucose absorption due to meals, and the last 3 equations describe the glucose-insulin kinetics subsystem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Linearized Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "We linearized the nonlinear dynamics above around the steady state $x_{ss} = \\begin{bmatrix}120.0 & 0.0016 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 1.5081 &10.2735 & 0.2827 & 120.0\\end{bmatrix}$ using a discretization step of 1 minute.\n",
    "The linearized dynamics model has the form\n",

    "- $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{9\\times2}$ is the input matrix, and\n",
    "- $h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{9\\times1}$ is the offset constant produced by the linearization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>NOTE</font>: There are three different time intervals: the time-discretization of the simulation (1 minute), the meal time interval (5 minutes), and the controller actuation time interval (up to you).\n"

    "simulate() runs a sytem simulation. It takes the following inputs:\n",
    "- basal_handler: the function/controller that returns the  basal insulin injection value\n",
    "- basal_handler_params: dict() with parameters defined by the control designer that can be accessed during simulation by the handler\n",
    "- data_given: a pandas dataframe that describes the meal intake. The example below shows how to create the dataframe by reading the meal csv file (the control designer may change the csv file or define multiple csv files/dataframes as needed)\n",

    "T1DModel: The T1DModel class is a part of ReplayBG's simulator and describes the glucose dynamics. It takes the following inputs:\n",
    "- data: pandas dataframe which contains the preliminary meal data (\"data\" is not very relevant as it is overwritten with data_given when simulate() is called)\n",
    "- bw: the body weight of the patient (the default value should be used)\n",
    "- yts: The continuous glucose measurement (cgm) sample time (the default value should be used)\n",
    "- glucose_model: the model equation to be used as measured glucose ('IG' should be used)\n",
    "- is_single_meal: a flag indicating if the model will be used as single meal or multi meal (the default value (False) should be used)\n",
    "- exercise: a boolean indicating if the model includes exercise (the default value (False) should be used)\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial control design should not need most of the inputs, as InsulinCo is primarily interested in performance on the basic/default case. For the bonus, you could consider changing some of the inputs. Keep in mind, InsulinCo is primarily interested in new control methods rather than exhaustive studies, so any parameter changes should be used/changed to demonstrate the value of a given controller, not for the sake of an exhaustive study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some additional functions from InsulinCo intended to make the ReplayBG simulator easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "get_linearization(): InsulinCO has provided this function to you to help design your controllers. It linearizes the dynamics around a given operating point but does *not* take into account the basal insulin injection delay. This means that for a given time index $t$ and a delay $tau$, the basal insulin injection value returned by the controller will only be seen by the system at the time step $t+tau$. This also means that for the same $t$, the control actions at the time steps between $t$ and $t+tau-1$ are already defined and cannot be changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>NOTE</font>: The ReplayBG simulator has a delay that is not included in the linearization. This delay must be factored in separately from the linearizaed dynamics described by the A matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "get_discretized_meals(): InsulinCo has provided this function to you to help interface between the ReplayBG simulator and the csv (that you may edit) that defines the meals. get_discretized_meals() is helpful because of how ReplayBG processes the meal data. Specifically, ReplayBG does some operations on the values written in the csv file to get the value of $m(t)$. Thus, to access this internal variable of ReplayBG, InsulinCo created this function which returns a vector with the all the $m[k]$ in a certain interval of time and according to a discretization time step.
